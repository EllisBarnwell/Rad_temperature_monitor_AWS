This project was designed to work with AWS for storing the temperature data.

# Requirements

## Hardware

I used nodeMCU v3 board as it's very cheap and has wifi. I'm sure that other boards could be used but code changes may be required for the microcontroller.

For each radiator you will typically need

 - 1 x nodeMCU board
 - 2 x 
 - 1 x power supply (could be batteries)
